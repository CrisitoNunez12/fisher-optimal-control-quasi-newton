# fisher-optimal-control-quasi-newton


This repository contains a minimal, fully reproducible implementation of the numerical experiments presented in the paper  Optimal Control of the Fisher Equation: A Comparison of Steepest Descent and Quasi-Newton Methods

The code reproduces results reported in Section 1.5 of the paper.

All numerical experiments were performed on a workstation equipped with:

- Intel Core i7 processor (3.4 GHz)
- 16 GB RAM
- Linux Ubuntu 22.04

No parallelization was used.

Run the main Jupyter notebook to reproduce:
- Table 1.1 (iteration counts and execution times)
- Convergence plots
- Optimal control, state, and adjoint profiles

All figures generated by the code are saved automatically in a new directory.
